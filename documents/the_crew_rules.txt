THE CREW: QUEST FOR PLANET NINE - COMPLETE RULES AND INSTRUCTIONS

GAME OVERVIEW:
The Crew is a cooperative trick-taking card game for 2-5 players. Players work together as astronauts on a space mission to find the mysterious Planet Nine. The game consists of 50 missions with increasing difficulty. Players must win specific tricks containing certain cards, but communication is severely limited!

GAME COMPONENTS:
- 40 Game cards (numbered 1-9 in four colors: Pink, Blue, Green, Yellow, plus four special Rocket cards numbered 1-4)
- 36 Task cards (showing which cards must be won)
- 16 Tokens (5 arrow tokens, 5 reminder tokens, 5 communication tokens, 1 commander token)
- 1 Mission logbook with 50 missions
- 5 large task overview cards (one per player)

CARD HIERARCHY:
In each of the four colored suits (Pink, Blue, Green, Yellow), cards are ranked 1 (lowest) to 9 (highest).
Rocket cards are TRUMP cards and always beat colored cards. Rockets rank 1 (lowest) to 4 (highest).

SETUP:
1. Choose a mission from the logbook. Each mission specifies how many task cards to use and any special rules.
2. Shuffle the 40 game cards and deal them evenly to all players. In 3-player games, remove all cards numbered 1-3 from the deck before dealing. In 4-player games, each player gets 10 cards. In 5-player games, each player gets 8 cards.
3. The player who receives the Rocket 4 card becomes the Commander and takes the Commander token.
4. Place the specified number of task cards face-up in the center of the table.
5. Give each player a task overview card for reference.

DISTRIBUTING TASKS:
The Commander chooses one task card from the center and places it in front of any player (including themselves). Then, proceeding clockwise, each player chooses a task card and assigns it to any player. Continue until all task cards are distributed.
IMPORTANT: Each player must win the tricks containing the cards shown on their assigned task cards.

MISSION REQUIREMENTS:
Some missions have special requirements shown with tokens placed on task cards:
- NUMBERED TOKENS (1, 2, 3, etc.): Tasks must be completed in the specified order. Place these tokens on task cards to show the sequence.
- ARROW TOKEN (>): The task with this token must be completed BEFORE the next task.
- OMEGA TOKEN (Ω): The task with this token must be completed LAST, after all other tasks.

HOW TO PLAY - TRICK-TAKING RULES:
The Commander leads the first trick by playing any card from their hand. Going clockwise, each player must:
1. FOLLOW SUIT if possible (play a card of the same color as the led card).
2. If unable to follow suit, play any card (including a Trump/Rocket card).

WINNING A TRICK:
- The highest card of the led suit wins the trick UNLESS a Trump/Rocket was played.
- If one or more Trump/Rocket cards were played, the highest Trump/Rocket wins.
- The winner of the trick leads the next trick.

When a trick is won, check if it contains a card shown on any player's task card:
- If the player who won the trick has that task card in front of them, they have completed that task! Turn the task card face-down.
- If the player who won the trick does NOT have that task card, the mission is FAILED immediately.

COMMUNICATION RULES:
Communication is STRICTLY LIMITED. Players cannot discuss strategy, hint about their cards, or show reactions. HOWEVER, once per mission, each player may use their communication token:

1. Place your communication token on any card in your hand.
2. Depending on where you place the token, you communicate:
   - Token on TOP of card = "This is my HIGHEST card in this color"
   - Token on BOTTOM of card = "This is my LOWEST card in this color"  
   - Token in MIDDLE of card = "This is my ONLY card in this color"

RESTRICTIONS on communication:
- You can only communicate once per mission.
- Once you've communicated, you cannot take back or change your communication.
- You cannot communicate about Trump/Rocket cards.
- The Commander must wait until all players have played one card in the first trick before communicating.
- After communication, other players may now communicate on their turns.

RADIO COMMUNICATION (available in some missions):
Some missions show a radio symbol. In these missions, players may briefly discuss before distributing tasks. The Commander decides when discussion ends. Once tasks are distributed, normal communication rules apply.

DISTRESS SIGNAL:
If the mission seems impossible to complete, any player may call a "Distress Signal" to abort the mission and try again. However, this counts as a failed attempt. After 3 failed attempts (including Distress Signals), you may skip that mission and move to the next one.

WINNING AND LOSING:
MISSION SUCCESS: You win the mission when all task cards are completed (face-down) and all tricks have been played.
MISSION FAILURE: The mission fails immediately if:
- A player wins a trick containing a card from another player's task card
- A task is completed out of order (when numbered tokens are used)
- All tricks are played but not all tasks are completed

After completing a mission, move to the next mission in the logbook. The goal is to complete all 50 missions!

VARIANTS FOR DIFFERENT PLAYER COUNTS:
2-PLAYER VARIANT: Use only cards 5-9 in each color plus all Rockets. Deal 10 cards to each player. Play is simultaneous – both players play a card, the higher card wins.

3-PLAYER VARIANT: Remove cards 1-3 before dealing. Adjust task card numbers as specified in mission logbook.

STRATEGY TIPS:
- Use communication wisely! Save it for critical moments.
- Pay attention to what others communicate – it reveals important information.
- The Commander should carefully observe all players before making decisions.
- When distributing tasks, consider who is likely to win certain tricks based on their position.
- Sometimes winning a trick early is important; other times, you want to lose tricks.
- Trump/Rocket cards are powerful but should be used strategically.
- In later missions with multiple tokens, plan the sequence carefully.

ADVANCED STRATEGY:
- Card counting is essential – remember what's been played.
- The player after the Commander has an advantage as they see the led card before playing.
- Sometimes it's strategic to take a task card that seems difficult to prevent others from getting stuck with it.
- Use low cards early to clear suits so you can play freely later.
